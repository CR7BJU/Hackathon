**The 3-Body Problem**

The 3-Body Problem consists of taking the initial positions and velocities of three bodies and solving their corresponding motion (or trajectory) according to Newton's laws of motion. Why is this challenging? Let's first consider the 2 body problem.

**The 2-body problem**

This problem asks the question "What are the trajectories of two masses in space if the only force acting on them is their mutual attraction?". Essentially, we consider an isolated system of two masses and wish to find their trajectories from a given initial position, when their motion is governed by Newton's laws. We can find a solution for this problem by solving the corresponding system of differential equations. For 2 bodies a closed-form solution can be found by re-formulating it as two one-body problems. That is, we can obtain explicit expressions for the evolution of the position of both bodies.
The 3-body problem

The 3 body problem is an extension of the 2-body problem with 3 masses. The addition of the third body drastically increases the difficulty of the problem and generally leads to a chaotic, i.e. non-periodic, system. Explicit solutions for the system of differential equations of the 3-body problem do not exist. Consequently, the problem is typically addressed with numerical integration, which has prohibitive computational costs and is extremely time-consuming. Thus, despite the long-time interest in this problem, its solution remains very challenging.
